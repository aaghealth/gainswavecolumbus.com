<p>I went to Medical school at The University of Florida College of Medicine. I came up to Ohio for residency training where I have been ever since. I spent 10 years doing Urgent Care and 20 years in Family Practice. I did my fellowship in Anti-aging and Regenerative Medicine with A4M and opened my own wellness practice. I primarily work with bioidentical hormone replacement for women and testosterone replacement for men; but also do a lot of work with low thyroid, chronic fatigue, adrenal stress and gut issues. I currently provide the O shot and P shot for my patients and am excited to become a provider of the Gaineswave procedure</p>
