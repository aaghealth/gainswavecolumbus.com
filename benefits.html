As more than 50% of men between the ages of 30 and 65 experience some degree of erectile dysfunction, GAINSWave has greatly increased in popularity since its inception in Miami. </p>

<p>With so many men dealing with ED or the anxiety of performance issues, it was gladly welcomed by Miami locals, from Europe, as the first form of low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy in the U.S. </p>

<p>Place your sexual health in the hands of the leading pioneer for men’s sexual health in the U.S., Dr. Richard Gaines. Dr. Gaines is an established, globally renowned men’s sexual health expert and is the creator of the GAINSWave.

<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
<h2>GAINSWave is a unique form of a widely proven medical practice known as low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy (Li-ESWT). Shockwave therapy involves the transfer of acoustic waves into the body and is completely non-invasive, pain-free, side-effect free, and drug-free. By transferring the energy from the acoustic waves into the soft tissue of the body, Li-ESWT promotes healing and growth within the body. </h2>

<img src="/assets/images/ed-treatment8.jpg" alt="{{page.title}} {{site.keyword_location}}" class="pageimg imgright"><p>Scientists in Europe have been working on an application of of Li-ESWT for men’s sexual health conditions. What their studies have found is that when an air compressor applicator is applied to the male genitals, and applies sound waves into the penis, that those sound waves push energy through the soft tissue of the penis and promote two vitally important process to healthy erections, Angiogenesis and Neovascularization. Angiogenesis is the repair and growth of existing blood vessels, while Neovascularization is the generation of new blood vessels. </p>

<p>The root cause of erectile dysfunction is poor blood flow to the penis. This occurs through a block either in blood flow through the blood vessels or a block in the mind’s response to sexual stimulus to send blood to the penis in preparation for sexual intercourse. In cases of poor blood flow through the blood vessels, GAINSWave can help improve blood flow by providing more and better avenues for blood to reach the penis and for men to experience healthy erections.</p>
