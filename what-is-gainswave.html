<h2>Having Problems in the Bedroom?</h2>

<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>

<img src="/assets/images/ed-treatment7.jpg" alt="{{page.title}} {{site.keyword_location}}" class="pageimg imgright">
<p>Steady blood flow is the key to erectile function. As men age, the blood vessels in the penis deteriorate and fill with micro-plaque reducing blood flow to the penis. For over 15 years, therapy similar to GAINSWave&trade; known as Shockwave therapy has been successfully used in Europe to help men with ED. However, it&rsquo;s new to the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p>GAINSWave&trade; therapy uses pulsed acoustic waves to open existing blood vessels and stimulate the formation of new ones. The resulting improved blood flow helps any man, not only those with ED, to obtain stronger and more sustainable erections. &nbsp;</p>
