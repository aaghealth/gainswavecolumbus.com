<p>Peyronie’s Disease is a condition that describes men suffering from scar buildup on the penis that results in a bent, curved, twisted and potentially painful erection. Plaque will build up underneath the skin of the penis as a result of trauma, genetics or unidentified cause and prevent the skin of the penis to stretch during an erection, causing the potentially painful curve. </p>

<p>Doctors in Europe and around the globe have been utilizing shockwave therapy and analyzing its effectiveness for treating these symptoms of Peyronie’s Disease in clinical trials and patient procedures. It has shown great progress in reducing the pain associated with PD and while it has not proven 100% effective in eliminating the scar tissue and plaque buildup that causes PD in all cases, the acoustic waves that are generated in shockwave therapy have proven effective in breaking down scar tissue in other applications. As more research is conducted, it could be likely that doctors will recommend forms of shockwave therapy, such as GAINSWave, as the best solution to treating PD.</p>
<h2>Symptoms of Peyronie’s Disease</h2>
<p>While the symptoms of Peyronie’s Disease are fairly clear and self-diagnosable, they require the attention of a medical specialist to remediate. Contact your local male health clinic if you notice any of these symptoms - </p>
<ul>
<li>Scarring or plaque buildup on the base of the penis</li>
<li>A slight bend in the penis when erect</li>
<li>A notable curve in the penis when erect</li>
<li>A severe twist of the penis when erect</li>
<li>Pain in the penis when erect</li>
</ul>
<h2>Peyronie’s Disease and Erectile Dysfunction</h2>
<img src="/assets/images/peyronie-treatment2.jpg" alt="{{page.title}} {{site.keyword_location}}" class="pageimg imgright"><p>Many cases of Peyronie’s Disease result in painful and potentially harmful erections for those afflicted. To avoid discomfort or harm, the bodies of those suffering from PD may develop erectile dysfunction as a preservative measure. This is why there is such a common correlation between PD and ED with 80% of patients with Peyronie’s Disease also suffering from erectile dysfunction. It is not uncommon, due to GAINSWave’s benefits for men with both PD and ED, for patients of GAINSWave to see both of their sets of symptoms be simultaneously treated by GAINSWave therapy. </p>
<h2>How GAINSWave Combats Symptoms of PD</h2>
<p>The sound waves generated in a GAINSWave treatment work to breakdown the fibrous plaque that has built up on the patient’s penis. For treatments that are successful in the elimination of this fibrous scar tissue, the skin on the penis is able to regain its full elasticity and straightness during an erection. This helps to eliminate the pain associated with PD.</p>

<p>In cases where the scar tissue is not fully removed, GAINSWave treatments introduce into the patient’s body, a pain remedy that works to reduce the pain that comes with curved erections. Substance P is a pain mediator that is generated in GAINSWave therapy that helps patients achieve pain-free erections to reclaim their sex lives. </p>
<h2>The Safer Alternative</h2>
<p>While studies are being conducted as to shockwave therapy’s overall effectiveness in remediating all symptoms of PD, it is by far the safest form of male enhancement and PD treatment due to its noninvasive nature and lack of chemicals. Studies have shown that acoustic waves have the ability to breakdown deposits of calcified fibers without causing harmful side effects and for patients suffering from painful erections, GAINSWave can eliminate this pain. By introducing a pain moderator, Substance P, GAINSWave therapy helps to relieve the pain associated with Peyronie’s Disease even if it has yet to remove the patient’s scar tissue and the ensuing curve that it causes.</p>
