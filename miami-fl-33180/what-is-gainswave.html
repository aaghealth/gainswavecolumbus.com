Through the use of acoustic waves, studies in Europe have considered extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) to be a cure for erectile dysfunction. Utilizing this proven technology, GAINSWave provides a Pain-Free, Non-Invasive, Drug-Free, Long-term and Quick treatment option for men with ED or other performance issues.</p>
<h2>Having Problems in the Bedroom?</h2>
<p>If you are a man over the age of 30, there is nothing you fear more than not being able to perform while you are in your bed with your partner. Not only can this be very frustrating and embarrassing, but it’s just the beginning of a long battle to sustain your sex life. </p>

<p>Whether you are unable to achieve an erection, achieving erections that are softer than your normal erections or erections that do not last as long as they once have, erectile dysfunction impedes your sexual abilities which, in turn, impacts your sex life and potentially your relationships. A man’s ability to perform and satisfy his partner is a major pride point. GAINSWave can help men with ED, Peyronie’s disease or without any sexual health issues maximize their performance and have the best sex of their lives. </p>
<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
<p>The science behind GAINSWave has been developed in Europe for decades. What scientists have found is that when acoustic waves are introduced to a person’s skin, it will transfer wave energy into the recipients soft tissue. This energy is full of healing and growth factors that stimulate the remediation of many injuries, illnesses and conditions. </p>

<p>In cases of erectile dysfunction, the soundwaves work to create the processes of Angiogenesis, the healing and growth of existing blood vessels, and Neovascularization, the generation of new blood vessels. This helps to treat the most common form of ED - vasculogenic erectile dysfunction - which is caused by low blood flow to the penis. Without a sufficient and sustained flow of blood, the penis will not lengthen, expand or achieve the necessary rigidity for sexual intercourse. By expanding existing blood vessels and creating new ones, GAINSWave improves blood flow to the patient’s penis, which is how scientists in Europe have supported its effectiveness as a sexual performance enhancement treatment. </p>
<h2>The GAINSWave Procedure</h2>
<img src="/assets/images/ed-treatment7.jpg" alt="{{page.title}} {{site.keyword_location}}" class="pageimg imgright"><p>After meeting with your local Miami ED specialist and discussing your symptoms and coming to a complete diagnosis, your treatment will be scheduled. The GAINSWave process is very quick with treatments lasting between 20 to 30 minutes. Patients will lie down and receive a water-based gel around the treatment area to help the applicator glide more comfortably. The ED doctor in Miami will then apply soundwaves to the necessary areas of the patient’s genitals in order to promote healthy blood flow. Patients should not experience pain or even discomfort. Because the process in completely non-invasive and drug-free, patients will not have any adverse effects following the appointment. Many men have claimed improvements immediately following the procedure and these benefits should last long-term. </p>
<h2>Benefits of GAINSWave</h2>
<p>The healing effects of acoustic waves are greatly noticed for men with and without sexual health concerns. Studies in Europe have shown the technology behind GAINSWave to improve cases of sexual impotence and peyronie’s disease. For men without these conditions, GAINSWave has also been shown to improve sexual performance and sensation. Men over 30 can benefit from GAINSWave in these ways - </p>

<p><strong><u>Erectile Dysfunction Relief</u></strong> - For men with cases of vasculogenic erectile dysfunction, GAINSWave can assist in improving blood flow by expanding the blood vessels in the patient’s penis and generating new blood vessels. This improves the blood flow to the peni which creates long, strong and lasting erections for men. </p>

<p><strong><u>Peyronie’s Disease Relief</u></strong> - Peyronie’s disease is a condition that men face when scar tissue builds up underneath the skin, which causes curved and potentially painful erections. The man’s body will often create erectile dysfunction to prevent these harmful and painful erections. GAINSWave works to breakdown this scar tissue and relieve instances of PD to create straighter, healthier and pain-free erections.</p>

<p><strong><u>Sexual Performance</u></strong> - Studies and clinical trials have shown GAINSWave to increase blood flow, which means even for men without ED, their erections will be stronger, longer lasting and in some instances thicker and longer. GAINSWave can also improve sensitivity, leading to better feeling sex!</p>
