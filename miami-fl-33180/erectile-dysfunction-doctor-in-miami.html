<h2>Advanced Approach</h2>

He would watch has himself and his colleagues would prescribe medications that would only suppress their patients’ symptoms only to have them come back for more and more medications. </p>

<p>Dr. Gaines’ mentality surrounding treating his patients is to focus on the root cause of their illnesses or conditions.
