<p>For many years, men with ED have resorted to oral ED medications to relieve their symptoms. While oral medications for erectile dysfunction can be effective offering men a simple solution to ED, the results are temporary and can bring side effects for both the men using them and their lovers. </p>

<p>This has prompted urologists and other doctors around the globe to develop a Viagra alternative to treating cases of erectile dysfunction. Studies conducted in Europe have shown great progress for one ED treatment in particular - Low-Intensity Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (Li-ESWT). </p>

<p>Taking  a proven medical treatment, shockwave therapy, and applying it at lower intensities to the male genitalia, studies show that the acoustic waves generated from Li-ESWT can promote healing and growth for men with erectile dysfunction. This healing comes in the form of Angiogenesis, a process that repairs blood vessels, while the growth comes from Neovascularization, the creation of new blood vessels. </p>

<p>When these two processes are combined through shockwave therapy, it addresses the root cause of poor sexual performance for men - poor blood flow. By expanding existing blood vessels in the penis and creating new avenues for more blood to flow into the penis, Li-ESWT is shown to create healthier, longer, fuller and more sustained erections for men with and without erectile dysfunction. These process are also permanent and sustainable, so the results are much longer lasting than the average ED treatments in Miami. </p>
<h2>A Safer Alternative to Viagra</h2>
<p>A local Miami ED specialist, Dr. Richard Gaines, saw this new procedure as an opportunity to provide his male sexual health patients a Viagra alternative that could provide longer lasting results in a safer, more natural way. Dr. Gaines is a globally renowned sexual health expert that has is pioneering the field of sexual health in the U.S. with his own proprietary ED treatment, GAINSWave. </p>

<img src="/assets/images/ed-treatment2.jpg" alt="{{page.title}} {{site.keyword_location}}" class="pageimg imgright"><p>GAINSWave utilizes the tested application of Li-ESWT that improves men’s performances with Dr. Gaines’ own unique standards and practices. GAINSWave offers patients a successful and safe erectile dysfunction treatment option that is shown to give men improved performance as well as relief from the symptoms of ED and peyronie’s disease. </p>

<p>GAINSWave and other forms of Li-ESWT achieve this level of safety and success by utilizing a technology that is noninvasive in nature. Erectile dysfunction doctors in Miami will utilize an air compressor applicator that sends a wave of pulsed energy into the patient’s soft tissue. By using acoustic wave energy, there is no physical contact with the patient. Shockwave therapy is also not dependent upon drugs that can carry harmful side effects. </p>

<p>So by using low intensity waves, not coming into direct contact with the patient and not injecting the patient with any chemicals, shockwave therapy is completely pain-free and side effect free. </p>
<h2>Tested Results</h2>
<p>In studies that have been conducted by European urologists, the Li-ESWT technology is proven to provide ED patients an 80% success rate in treating symptoms of sexual impotence, while all patients who have received shockwave therapy have expressed a 90% satisfaction rate for improved performance. Based on these studies and the results of current patients, those who receive GAINSWave can achieve great improvements to their sexual health, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Longer lasting erections</li>
<li>The ability to achieve as many erections in a day; at any time and without waiting</li>
