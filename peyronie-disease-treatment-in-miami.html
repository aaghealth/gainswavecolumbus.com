<p>Over the past two decades scientists in Europe have been developing an application of a well-known method of healing, shockwave therapy, for men’s sexual health. What they have found in multiple case studies and clinical trials is that when applied at a low-intensity, the acoustic waves created in shockwave therapy can noninvasively and without the use of drugs, promote healing and growth within a male’s genitals. The studies have shown an 80% success rate for treating erectile dysfunction and a 90% success rate in improving patients’ performances in bed. </p>

<p>For men with Peyronie’s Disease, a condition that is caused by the buildup of scar tissue underneath the skin of the penis that leads to a painful and potentially harmful curve when the penis is erect, GAINSWave may be of assistance. Patients with PD who have received shockwave therapy have been observed with improved symptoms. The sound waves generated from the air compression applicator that is used in GAINSWave treatments are able to address the pain associated with PD</p>
<h2>Why GAINSWave Over Other Alternatives</h2>
<p>Peyronie’s Disease is an extremely uncomfortable and delicate condition. With nearly 80% of PD sufferers developing erectile dysfunction to prevent them from achieving erections because they are too painful and harmful to the patient, it’s a condition that should not be taken lightly. Not only are oral ED medications unsuccessful in treating the symptoms of peyronie’s disease, but because it is so common for the unnatural curvature of a PD sufferer’s erection to cause the patient pain, it will warn users not to take the pill, if they have PD, on the bottle. Surgery is also a very risky option for Peyronie’s Disease patients. Attempting to remove the scar tissue from the base of the penis is a nearly impossible task and can lead to serious consequences if not executed perfectly. </p>

<p>GAINSWave is completely noninvasive and does not use any harmful chemicals. It addresses the pain associated with Peyronie’s Disease by introducing a pain reduction agent - Sustance P. Studies are still being conducted for pulsed wave therapy’s efficacy for breaking down scar tissue in cases of PD, though it is effective at breaking down calcified fibers. Once this scar tissue is broken down, the skin on the base of the penis can retain its naturally elasticity. This helps men with PD achieve straight, healthy and pain-free erections. </p>
<h2>Your Peyronie’s Disease Consultation in Miami</h2>
<p>Consultations for GAINSWave are focused on identifying the condition that is being treated, if any. In cases of PD, doctors will listen to the patient’s symptoms and perform a physical examination to determine the severity of the condition and best steps moving forward for treatment. The Miami men’s health specialist will then go over the details of the procedure to make sure the patient is completely comfortable and understands how the GAINSWave process is going to improve their sexual health. The doctor will then schedule your appointment and answer any final questions you may have. </p>
<h2>What to Expect at Your Appointment</h2>
<p>When you come into the Miami male clinic for your appointment, you should expect your appointment to last around 30 minutes. The procedure will begin with you lying down on the table and the physician applying a water-based gel to the treatment area. The gel helps the applicator glide seamlessly across the penis without friction. Over a period of intervalled applications of sound waves, the physician will work to reduce pain and attempt to break down the built up plaque that is causing your PD symptoms. </p>
