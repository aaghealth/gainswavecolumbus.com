<p>Peyronie's Disease (PD) is a condition where scar tissue (plaque) develops under the skin surface of the penis causing it to bend or curve during erections. It can cause significant pain and sexual dysfunction in men. Plaque that develops can be the result of trauma, penile injections, genetics or an unknown cause.</p>

<h2>Peyronie&rsquo;s Disease and Erectile Dysfunction</h2>
<p>Many cases of Peyronie&rsquo;s Disease result in pain with or without an erection. Often, those with PD will subsequently develop erectile dysfunction as the bodies way of defending itself against potential pain. GAINSWave&trade; therapy can break up scar tissue, providing significant relief from PD symptoms, simultaneously treating any ED symptoms as well, allowing men to enjoy a healthy sex life once again.</p>
<h3>How GAINSWave&trade; Combats Symptoms of PD</h3>
<p>The pulsed acoustic waves generated in GAINSWave&trade; therapy work to break up the fibrous plaque that has built up under the skin, eliminating the cause of the curvature and other related symptoms.</p>
<h3>The Safer Alternative</h3>
<p>GAINSWave is by far the safest form of male enhancement and PD treatment due to its noninvasive nature and lack of chemicals. Studies have shown that acoustic waves have the ability to break down deposits of plaque without causing harmful side effects and patients suffering from painful erections. Depending on severity, your GAINSWave&trade; doctor may recommend a combination of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) and GAINSWave&trade; therapy to promote better, faster and more pain-free results.</p>
