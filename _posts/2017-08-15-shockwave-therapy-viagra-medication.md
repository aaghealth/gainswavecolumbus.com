<p>In 40% of men over 40 and in up to 70% of men aged 70, erectile dysfunction (ED) is the condition characterized by inability to develop or maintain an erection during sexual activity. Up until now, the “little blue pill” has been what these men have gotten from their erectile dysfunction doctors for an active sex life. Some have received no treatment, suffering ED because they were embarrassed and couldn’t volunteer the problem to their healthcare provider.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to now: non-drug treatments for ED such as shock wave therapy are here, and such ED treatment options are revolutionizing how erectile dysfunction is treated.</p>
<p>No longer should erectile dysfunction ruin your sex life and no longer need you depend on a little blue pill or other ED medications—prescription medications—to achieve and maintain an erection; discuss your  ED treatment options with an erectile dysfunction doctor today.</p>

<h2>Downfalls of Traditional Erectile Dysfunction Medication</h2>
<p>Erectile dysfunction typically has been treated with prescription medication such as Viagra®, Stendra®, Cialis®, and Levitra®. These ED medications work by relaxing muscles and boosting blood flow to the penis, causing an erection or maintaining it. However, there are many disadvantages to such prescription medications, which were all originally based on medication developed to treat things other than erectile dysfunction. Besides fatigue, consider the other unwanted side effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Headache</li>
  <li>Upset stomach or heartburn</li>
  <li>Body aches/pain, including back pain</li>
  <li>Nasal congestion</li>
  <li>Visual changes</li>
  <li>Hearing loss</li>
  <li>Digestive system problems</li>
  <li>Dizziness</li>
  <li>Skin flushes</li>
</ul>
<p>These prescription medications also require the inconvenience of maintaining the medicines as long as you want to maintain the solution to ED. It’s a lifelong commitment and only a temporary patch for the problem. But this scenario gets worse.</p>
<p>Taking erectile dysfunction medications is just plain awkward, since it involves a lot of planning that overshadows the “turn on” of spontaneity, important in sex. And then…it gets even worse! An exaggerated reaction to an erectile dysfunction medication can cause a prolonged erection, which has the potential to damage the penis severely. If there are two phrases that men don’t like hearing together, they are “your penis” and “severe damage.”</p>
<h2>Shock Wave Therapy for Erectile Dysfunction</h2>
<p>Normal erectile function requires healthy blood flow to the penis, and with age the flow tends to diminish as the blood vessels responsible for supplying unobstructed blood can gradually become blocked. Of course, loss of function ensues. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), commonly called shock wave therapy, can solve this problem. Shock wave therapy is a procedure in which energy from acoustic (sound) waves are used to target different areas of the body—even the penis—to improve blood flow.</p>
<p>During a typical erectile dysfunction shock wave therapy session, a probe, coated with special gel is applied to your penis. Different areas are targeted as waves stimulate these areas. This stimulates dormant cells in the penis to undergo what is called neovascularization, whereby new blood vessels begin to form in the once-constricted areas to enhance tissue growth and re-establish good circulation.</p>
<h2>Benefits of shock wave therapy for ED include:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Unlike all of the prescription ED medications, there are few side effects</li>
  <li>The procedure is totally non-invasive and requires no surgery</li>
  <li>Instead of a cumbersome maintenance strategy like with prescription medications for ED, the procedure offers lasting results with little to no downtime</li>
  <li>The procedure is a good investment of your time, for it requires very little for a big payoff</li>
</ul>
<p>Fast-forward again. A revolutionary form of extracorporeal shockwave therapy, GAINSWave™ erectile dysfunction treatment, is now available with a 90% success rate among ED patients. Each procedure consists of a 20-30 minute commitment and upon successful treatment, results typically last up to 2 years. (Compare with the half-life of Viagra and Cialis, half of which are metabolized within 6 hours and 18 hours, respectively.) Years vs. hours. It’s the difference between being erectile functional and erectile dysfunctional.</p>
