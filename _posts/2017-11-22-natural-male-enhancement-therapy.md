<p>A critical component in most healthy functioning relationships is an active and pleasurable sex life. For men, this typically means achieving strong and long-lasting erections during sexual intercourse. Age, stress, performance anxiety and other lifestyle factors can interfere with your sexual performance and lead you to seek male enhancement treatment either at your local drug store or from your healthcare provider. Even for men who consider themselves problem-free in the bedroom, the thought of further enhancing their sexual abilities is often highly desirable.</p>

This natural therapy utilizes shock wave therapy to promote new blood vessel growth, thereby increasing blood flow to your penis to help facilitate stronger erections.</p>

<h2>Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) & Male Enhancement</h2>

<p><u>Extracorporeal shockwave therapy</u> (ESWT) is a noninvasive procedure which utilizes acoustic sound waves to stimulate your body’s natural healing mechanisms, thereby promoting new tissue and blood vessel growth, and restoring blood flow to the penis. The better the blood flow is to the penis, the stronger the erection you will have.</p>

<p>While the term “shock wave” can be jolting for some, ESWT is in fact gentle; it simply employs pain-free, pulsating sound waves to your penis. ESWT has been proven in clinical trials to help men with a range of sexual complaints—from severe erectile dysfunction to men simply seeking slight performance improvements—achieve and maintain erections they previously thought were no longer attainable.</p>

<p>ESWT is not solely used for <i>male sexual performance;</i> it is also utilized in many other medical specialties including physical therapy, orthopedics and cardiology for its pervasive ability to stimulate healing.</p>
