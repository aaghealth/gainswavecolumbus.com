This is why doctors in Europe have been working on generating an effective, drug-free, non-invasive and long-term solution to erectile dysfunctions. This procedure utilizes low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy to stimulate improved blood flow for men with erectile dysfunction as a result of low blood flow. </p>

<p>A clinic in Miami picked up on this technology and introduced it to the U.S. via their proprietary treatment, GAINSWave. Using this same shockwave technology, GAINSWave is able to introduce acoustic waves into the affected area to promote healthy blood flow.</p>
<h2>The Science Supporting GAINSWave</h2>
<p>For decades, scientists in Europe have been developing and testing the applications of a proven healing technology, shockwave therapy, for its abilities to assist men with sexual health issues. Shockwave therapy utilizes the energy that is generated from acoustic waves to promote healing and growth factors in the body. When the waves are pulsed through soft tissue, it transfers this healing energy into the patient’s body. </p>

<p>Urologists and scientists in Europe hypothesized that this healing effect could be applied to the soft tissue of the penis to promote proper sexual health. With the use of an air compressor applicator, doctors sent air from the applicator through the penis and in doing so, transferred the energy of the compressed air into the penis.</p>

<img src="/assets/images/ed-treatment5.jpg" alt="{{page.title}} {{site.keyword_location}}" class="pageimg imgright"><p>What they’ve found is that the energy works to stimulate the repair of the blood vessels in the penis which supply blood to the penis during times of sexual arousal. When these blood vessels are diminished or damaged, they don’t supply enough blood to the penis to create healthy erections. By improving existing blood vessels (Angiogenesis) and generating new ones (Neovascularization), GAINSWave addresses the root cause of erectile dysfunction and has been shown to provide effective and long-lasting relief to ED. </p>
<h2>A Consultation with a Miami ED Doctor</h2>
<p>It all starts with a consultation to establish the fit for shockwave therapy. Your erectile dysfunction doctor in Miami will want to know your symptoms and get to know your specific sexual concerns and wants from the treatment. As in most consultations, you will discuss your symptoms, medical history and the doctor will want to perform a physical examination to obtain a full understanding of your sexual health. </p>

<p>While GAINSWave does not carry side-effects and is suitable for men of all ages and degrees of sexual health, it’s still important for the men’s health specialist to familiarize himself with your case to establish the appropriate approach to treatment. </p>
<h2>Your GAINSWave Appointment</h2>
<p>The GAINSWave procedure is fairly quick with treatments lasting between 20-30 minutes. The appointment begins with the application of a water-based gel that helps the doctor apply the treatment more easily and keeps the patient comfortable. The erectile dysfunction doctor will then apply the air compressor applicator to the necessary treatment areas of the patient’s penis and genitals until enough acoustic wave energy has been transferred into the soft tissue to promote healthy blood vessel growth and generation, the treatment is over. </p>

<p>Patients should not experience much, if any, discomfort during or after the procedure. The procedure is drug-free, pain-free, side effect free and is shown in tests to provide long-term solutions to sexual health concerns for men. There is no downtime required. Patients have reported same day effectiveness in terms of erectile dysfunction relief. </p>
