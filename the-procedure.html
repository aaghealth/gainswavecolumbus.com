<h2>The Science Supporting GAINSWave</h2>
<p>As men age, blood vessels in the penis deteriorate and fill with micro-plaque. When these blood vessels are diminished or damaged, they don&rsquo;t supply enough blood to the penis to create healthy erections.</p>
<p>For decades, scientists in Europe have been using pulsed acoustic waves known as shockwave therapy, to assist men with Erectile Dysfunction and Peyronie&rsquo;s Disease. GAINSWave applies acoustic waves to the penis, which breaks up micro-plaque to open existing blood vessels as well as stimulate a natural biological reaction to boost the growth of new blood vessels. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This therapy, commercially known as GAINSWave&trade;, addresses the cause of erectile dysfunction and has been shown to provide effective and long-lasting relief to ED. Click here to read more research.</p>
