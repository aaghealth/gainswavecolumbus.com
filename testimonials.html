<p>&ldquo;Last year I had a bit of a down period, I was not having any fun anymore, and I noticed I was losing it. [Then I had the GAINSWave&trade;] and the results were staggering.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Due to ED, I have not been sexually active in over 5 years. Oral ED medications did not work for me.Now after getting the GAINSWave&trade;, I feel confident that I can be spontaneous and enjoy my relationship with my wife again. It&rsquo;s not very often you get a second chance to start over at my age, and I'm grateful for GAINSWave&trade; therapy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot begin to tell you how amazed I am with the results of the GAINSWave&trade;. I had the treatment, and I noticed a difference making love to my wife that very night!&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a man in my 40s. I wouldn&rsquo;t say I have ED, but my wife and I both noticed that things were not quite as good,&rdquo; as they used to be. It was taking longer to become aroused, and getting read a second time almost impossible. I heard a radio commercial about the GAINSWave&trade;, and decided to give it a shot. Man, was I happy I did, my wife says our sex life is the best it has been since our Honeymoon!&rdquo;</p>
