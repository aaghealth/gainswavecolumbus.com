<p>If you are a man over the age of 30, chances are, you are not performing quite the way you did in your 20s. You are also at a 50% risk of experiencing the effects of erectile dysfunction within the next 35 years, with the odds of ED becoming even greater after 35 years.</p>

<p>There is a male enhancement treatment in Miami that can greatly reduce this risk of experiencing ED and improve your performance without the risk of side effects, surgery or the inconvenience of taking daily medications. This procedure is known as GAINSWave and it is based on a widely tested method of male enhancement called shockwave therapy. Doctors in Europe have been testing its effectiveness for erectile dysfunction, peyronie’s disease and male enhancement for the past two decades. What they have found is that the audio waves generated from a shockwave applicator can work to improve a man’s blood flow in his penis. This increased blood flow helps keep men at their peak sexual health and performance.</p>
<h2>Sexual Health</h2>
<p>Erections are an important part of a man’s sexual health. They keep the skin around the penis flexible and elastic enough to handle the necessary growth and rigidity necessary for sexual intercourse. Another component of optimal sexual health for men is maintaining full and clear blood vessels in the penis. </p>

<p>GAINSWave helps improve the state of men’s blood vessels through a process called Angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is the healing and growth of blood vessels. The sound waves generated in a GAINSWave treatment also create new blood vessels in the penis through a process known as Neovascularization. These two process work in tandem to improve blood flow in the penis which works to prevent or improve cases of ED. </p>

<img src="/assets/images/ed-treatment3.jpg" alt="{{page.title}} {{site.keyword_location}}" class="pageimg imgright"><p>Studies in Europe are also identifying successful treatments of Peyronie’s Disease through shockwave therapy. The sound waves are able to break down the scar tissue that causes PD. This helps PD sufferers achieve healthier, straighter and more comfortable erections. </p>
<h2>Aging and Erectile Dysfunction</h2>
<p>As over 50% of men ages 30 to 65 are suffering from symptoms of erectile dysfunction, it’s nearly a matter of time before men over 30 experience issues performing in the bedroom. The root cause of erectile dysfunction is poor blood flow to the penis, which causes the softer erections, inability to achieve an erection or unsustained blood flow that leads to men prematurely losing their erections during sex. This can be caused by certain medical conditions such as diabetes, or overtime due to diet or other lifestyle choices that can damage or deteriorate blood vessels. </p>

<p>GAINSWave allows men to maintain their sexual abilities that they had in their 20s by keeping the blood vessels in the penis strong and healthy. </p>
<h2>Stronger Erections</h2>
<p>When men have healthy blood flow during times of sexual intrigue, their erections are sufficiently full. GAINSWave helps to maintain this preferred thickness by keeping the blood vessels in the penis structured and developing new blood vessels when necessary. This helps the penis fill with the necessary blood and achieve its best, hardest state for sexual intercourse. </p>
<h2>Improved Stamina</h2>
<p>Another benefit of healthy blood vessels in the penis is improved stamina. Men who have experienced ED during sexual intercourse should not experience this untimely event after a GAINSWave treatment. The improved blood vessels will allow a steady and consistent flow of blood throughout sexual intercourse to improve the patient’s stamina in bed. </p>
<h2>Size Increase</h2>
<p>The acoustic waves generated in shockwave therapy not only assist in blood vessel health, but also stimulate the production of healing and growth factors. These growth factors (stem cells) can actually work to grow the patient’s penis. GAINSWave patients have reported significant growth in both length and girth. </p>
<h2>Increased Sensation</h2>
<p>Patients will be having the best sex of their lives with increased sensitivity in the penis. The increased blood flow from your GAINSWave treatment will make sex actually feel even better. </p>
<h2>Proactive Maintenance</h2>
<p>As GAINSWave is a side-effect free male enhancement procedure, it allows men to maintain their best performance with routine treatments whenever they detect any signs of erectile dysfunction or worsening abilities. </p>

<p>Don’t wait for your best days to pass you by when GAINSWave is safe for patients of all ages and is growing equally in popularity amongst patients and physicians alike for its long-term benefits for men’s sexual health. <a href="http://gainswave.com/contact/">Contact</a> your local Miami GAINSWave provider today to schedule your consultation. </p>
